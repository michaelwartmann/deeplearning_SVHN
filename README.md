Assignments of the Udacity MOOC Deep Learning

This repository contains the code for the deep learning nanodegree capstone to train a deep neural network to recognize housenumbers in images.

## Requirements

1. TensorFlow
2. SciPy
3. Matplotlib
4. Numpy
5. Python 2.7
6. Pandas
7. Jupyter Notebook

## Downloading the data

url = 'http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/

## Usage

1. With Jupyter notebook start pre-processing the data. If the dataset is not downloaded yet, it can be downloaded via the script. The files are called image_processing_single_digits.ipynb and image_processing_multi_digits.ipynb
2. After pre-processing, using the SVHN_single_digit_convnet.ipynb and SVHN_multi_digit_convnet.ipynb to process the data into learning the network

## History

1.0: Initial release.
